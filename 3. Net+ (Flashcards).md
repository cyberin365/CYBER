	- what is OSPF? open source link-state routing protocol. best route takes into account bandwidth of each path. can load-balance between equal-cost routes (called ECMP equal cost multiple paths)
	- how is OSPF built up? routers flood LSA (link-state advertisements) every 30m (or when a change) to all other routers (not just direct neighbors), and each router recalculates djikstras on entire topology.
	- how is RIP built up? routers periodically sned their routing table every 30s ONLY to their direct neighbors. 
	- what is BGP? also myopic and decntralized like RIP. instead of advertising ip addresses to direct neighbors, advertises IP ranges, along with the AS required to pass through to get there. Takes into account business and legal policies to determine "best" paths.

	- what is ipv6 4in6? a tunnel method which is rare because usually the challenge is crossing older infrastructure which only supports ipv4
	- what is ipv4 dual-stack? every device and router from beginning to end have both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses. 
	- what is ipv6 translation? uses NAT64 and DNS64 to map ipv6 to a ipv4 address +port so that ipv6 devices can use older ipv4 services.

	- What is VTP? Cisco's VLAN management which dynamically creations, deletes, and renames VLANs

	- What is router on a stick? Inter-VLAN routing via an external router using subinterfaces on a trunk link
	- what is SVI? switched virtual interface. Inter-VLAN routing done internally by a Layer 3 switch via virtual interfaces for each VLAN. scale better than router on a stick.

	- What determines cost to the root bridge in STP? bandwidth. 10mb/100mb/1gb/10gb = 100/19/4/2 cost 
	- In STP, how does a switch determine designated ports vs non-designated/blocking ports? listen to neighbors BDPUs.
