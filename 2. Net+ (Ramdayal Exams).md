# UNTAUGHT THINGS
- Session Layer
	- RPC (remote procedure call) 
		- computer 1 executes code on remote computer 2 as if it was locally run
		- manages the session
	- SIP (session initiation protocol)
		- start and stop VoIP and video calls
	- PPTP (point to point tunneling protocol)
		- create VPN tunnels
	- NetBIOS
		- several APIs for network communications over LAN
- NFV (network functions virtualization)
	- instead of hardware, software on VMs
	- advnatages:
		- save costs / less physical equipment
		- flexible
		- vendor independence
- Direct connect
	- dedicated fiber optic connection from on-prem to AWS
	- advantages
		- faster / bandwidth
		- safer (but still need *internal* firewalls inside your local network
- Application aware networking
	- (usually a NGFW) can deep-inspect packets beyond the normal packet headers to find out what application the packet belongs to, then applies a QoS rule
- Zero Trust Architecture
	- "Deny by default" > "Never trust, always verify"
- NAT
	- Static vs Dynamic
		- static: fixed mapping
		- dynamic: temporary and chosen from a pool
- WPA3 vs WPA2
	- better security: replaced PSK with SAE (protects against offline dictionary attacks)
	- Easy connect: QR codes or NFC
	- OWE: although no authentication, still encrypts traffic on open public networks
- Fire suppression
	- Inert gas - best at not damaging
	- foam - residue issues
	- carbon dioxide - risk to humans
	- water - damage
- SNMP
	- v1 → v2
		- added bulk requests
		- added 64bit counters to prevent wrap-around
	- v2 → v3
		- replaced plain-text unencrypted community strings with USM (user based security model), which ensures traps transmitted and received
- SIEM
	- detects security incidents "as they occur" with "real-time correlation rules"
- Network Maintenance best practices
	- Redundant systems to cover (most effective)
	- notify users in advance
	- off-peak hours
	- maintain in small steps
- Security Metrics
	- FRR (false rejection rate) - Type 1 / False negative
	- FAR (false acceptance rate) - Type 2 / False positive
- ABAC
	- attribute based access control
	- more granular and flexible than RBAC,
		- user attributes, resource attributes, action(rwx), location, time of day, device
- Switch/Router CLI
	- `exec` (superuser) → `configure terminal` (configure mode) -> `interface GigabitEthernet 0/1` enter config mode for a specific port
		- administraively disable it: `shutdown`
		- Re-activate it: `no shutdown`
		- `switchport mode trunk`
		- `switchport mode access` make access port
		- `switchport access vlan 10` set the vlan for that access port
	- other stuff
		- `show running-config`
		- `show startup-config`
		- `show interfaces GigabitEthernet 0/1` check if port up or down
- Network contention
	- too many devices try to access same resource
	- solutions
		- VLANs to segment network (usually place voip on own vlan)
		- QoS
		- upgrade infrastructure for more bandwidth
- IGW (internet gateway)
	- where traffic goes between the internet and your VPC
	- has NAT
# Mistakes I made
- VLAN tagging is done at layer 2 (data link)
- NICs are part of BOTH layer 1 (physical) and layer 2 (data link)
- FHRP
	- devices point default gateway to a virtual IP
	- when a router fails, that virtual IP switches to a different router
- the boundaries of subnets are routers, the bounaries of ??? are switches
- Packet capture
	- network taps - network must be temporarily off to install physically
	- port mirroring - least efffect on network performance, can sitll oversubscript the monitoring port
	- firewall w packet capture capabilities - degrades firewalls performance, whose primary purpose isnt packet capture
	- software - degrades the device's performance
- Honeypot is only a single device, as opposed to honeynet
- antiviruses cant stop DOS attacks, because traffic content is legitimate, just overwhelming in volume
- Security options
	- enable BDPU guard - prevents rogue switches from being added into STP
	- Disable DTP on switch ports - dynamic trunking protocol automatically figures out if a swithc port should be access mode (single VLAN / end device) or trunk mode (multiple VLANs / connecting to another switch)
		- prevents switch snooping
	- DHCP Snooping - passively listens to all DHCP conversations on the network and builds a trusted databse of IP-to-MAC mappings.
		- prevents ARP poisoning if used with DAI (aka drop all invalid ARP packets)
	- port security / limit # of devices allowed per port
		- prevents MAC spoofing
	- Mac filtering only detects the violation, shutdown violation mode is the consequence 
- connectivity issues *in a certain section of building* rules out network congestion, but EMI intereference has to do with physical location
